                            No Blood, No Foul: The Hardest Hits in Sports History. 
                    
         There's an old saying that goes something like this: It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt, 
         and then it's hilarious. Okay, so that's not quite the saying. However, in sports, (contact or otherwise) 
         there are bound to be some hard hits, vicious collisions, and all around violence that might seem, just a tad 
         unnecessary. Hey, that's part of the job. If your manager asks you to lean into a 100mph fastball you do it! 
         You take that charge! Get sacked! Just sometimes, things might go pop or snap, or WHOOSH ( though, that's 
         probably your lungs getting punctured.) 
         
         In any case, this site will focus on athletic scenarios across a variety of sports that have gone down in history 
         because the men involved flew a little higher and got hit a little harder. It shows just how far guys are 
         willing to go to win, and how much guys are willing to take for the same thing. Some plays are dirty, some clean 
         but all are memorable and show a different side to America's most popular sports, and the amazing athletes 
         behind those plays. Pictures will be the primary focus of the site, showcasing the venue, athletes involved and
         the brutal play tha went down. Bios will be provided, often in an amusing and witty format like above. In 
         addition statistics and arious figures will be provied primarily in table format. If possible, video and audio 
         will be included. Site will be focus on the content, but it doesn't mean it won't look clean and polished. 
         Something has to look nice to take away from all that blood and sweat after all.
